The game of Drug Wars implemented in Forth.

The game configuration is held in config.txt and consists of a pseudo-TSV file. First row is the list of drugs, each subsequent row is a city followed by a low and high price for each drug.

The program itself is almost done, all it needs is to run the day cycle in a loop. Buying, selling, and jetting are all implemented. Random encounters are not implemented.
